Cusack and Zuniga are great in early roles.	review/text: How this movie slipped past me until almost 2000 I'll never know. My passion for going to movies has always been sporadic, with large gaps of time with either fanatacism or apathy towards  what type of movies were being put out. 1985 was when my interest was rekindled with boat loads of movies addressing my age group  I must have just missed this one. I'm a huge fan of John Cusack and Daphne Zuniga, the latter of who ranks way atop my all time fave females list. Having seen most of Zuniga's relatively low output of work (I refused to lower myself to watching "Melrose Place" just to catch a glimpse of her), being told about this movie caught me way off guard, since this is both her and Cusack at their earliest. This was the first movie they both had significant dialogue and camera time and they both make the most of it. In an era where most teen/post teen flicks were covered by the likes of John Hughes, director Rob Reiner in only his second film hits a home run. Hughes movies are awesome. They are time capsule candidates for many reasons. But "The Sure Thing" connects in a totally different way with its similarly aged cast and settings, giving us a movie that highlights a slew of mixed feelings by Cusack's and Zuniga's characters, some spoken, many unspoken until push comes to shove. I don't know what it is about Zuniga, but she's always had a strong appeal to me. Maybe it's because she comes across as the unpretentious type that every guy likes. In "Sure Thing" she wavers between that personna and the "in love with being in love" dedicated to her studies and her future husband who schools on the opposite west coast where Zuniga and Cusack's cross country Christmas time journey is taking them. What starts off as a case of two complete opposites that drive each other crazy turns into an epiphany of feelings for each other despite their differences. By the movies end, it's safe to say that each has adopted a little of what makes the other person tick. Zuniga learns to loosen up a bit, while Cusack learns not to be too shallow. Reiner touches on genuine feelings and concerns of the college age characters, and from beginning to end paints a background of college experiences that anyone who's gone through it can totally relate to. He may get a little hokey or over-the-top in some scenes, in painting the straight laced extent of Zuniga's character for example. But his use of the surrounding character actors only helps soliidify the story in the foreground. "Sure Thing" Nicolette Sheridan, as the reason for Cusack's quest west, peaked in the gorgeous category with this movie. She's an abolute doll, a mere shadow of her "Desperate Housewives" character of the future. Viveca Lindfors, Tim Robbins and Anthony Edwards (during his "Nerd" years) all give major contributions with minimal screen time. Lindfors English Class Professor character and classroom setting put you in an authentic college atmosphere in bookend scenes that remind you by the movies' end that these are two young adults that are still evolving in school and in life. The closing scene is at the top of my all time romantic moments in the movies. A movie that's easy to watch repeatedly.

It's not the worst of his oeuvre by a long way - Beyond the Poseidon Adventure and When Time Ran Out are both much, much worse - but it's become the poster child for all the absurdities of the disaster genre at it's hokeyest. But then capsized ships with atom bombs aboard or volcanoes threatening hotel complexes can't compare to killer bees destroying nuclear power plants and causing train wrecks on the Richter Scale of movie absurdity. And it's a curiously second- and third-hand construction too - structurally Stirling Silliphant's script is surprisingly similar to his script for In the Heat of the Night. Okay, there weren't any bees in that one, but from the beginning where big city cop Sidney Poitier is discovered at a murder scene and immediately treated as a suspect by hard-case racist cop Rod Steiger until he gradually learns to respect his expertise, it's being used as a template, with sunflower seed munching entomologist Michael Caine discovered in a missile silo full of dead bodies by hard-case xenophobic general Richard Widmark, who immediately suspects him of their deaths until he gradually learns to respect his expertise (how can you not love a film where Bradford Dillman asks "Can we count on a scientist who prays?" only for Widmark to respond "I wouldn't count on one that didn't"?).<br /><br />But this isn't a film about trust or even narrative, it's about miscast and affordable stars getting stung to death in slow-motion by what look like bits of oatmeal painted black and fired at them by air-cannons. It's a film about hallucinating patients being menaced by imaginary giant bees. It's a film about military complexes with lots of flashing lights. It's a film about bad acting in the face of insurmountably inane dialogue ("Are you endowing these bees with human motives? Like saving their fellow bees from captivity, or seeking revenge on Mankind?" "I always credit my enemy, no matter what he may be, with equal intelligence." and "Billions of dollars have been spent to make these nuclear plants safe. Fail-safe! The odds against anything going wrong are astronomical, Doctor!" "I appreciate that, Doctor. But let me ask you. In all your fail-safe techniques, is there a provision for an attack by killer bees?" are just the tip of the iceberg). It's about bad fashion sense - this being the 70s, the decade that taste forgot, amid a preponderance of trouser flairs there are a lot of earth tones and oranges amid the costumes, so it's entirely possible that the bees simply mistook the actors for flowers waiting to be pollinated. And it's all done with a gloriously straight face and even, on a few rare occasions, some technical competence - Irwin Allen may have loved schmaltz, but he had a great visual sense when dealing with military hardware and there are some genuinely impressive shots in the picture when he gets to play with the toys. Unfortunately his handling of the actors is much more mechanical, with the old guard (Widmark, Olivia DeHavilland, Henry Fonda, Ben Johnson) faring better than poor old Caine and Katherine Ross. And, like many bad films, it's topped off by a superb score, one of Jerry Goldsmith's very best from his golden period. Much more fun than it's good to admit, the proposed remake has a lot to live up to.<br /><br />Warners' DVD is pretty good - the extended two-and-a-half hour cut in 2.35:1 widescreen from the old laserdisc release with a 1978 22-minute TV featurette on the making of the film plus the original trailer - but the sound, while acceptable, lacks much range.

Hyped from here to the moon, and called &quot;the most terrifying movie ever made&quot; by Allen himself, prior to its release, scientists everywhere were worried that it would cause a mass panic about bees. Not quite. THE SWARM turned out to be a bad movie. Drop your jaw bad. A movie that makes you ask again and again &quot;What made them think this would work!?&quot; A movie so bad that it is capable of giving the bad movie lover a buzz akin to those given by other substances.<p>When the always inept military finds a whole bunch of people dead at a nuclear missile base they think Chemical Warfare. Wrong. Turns out it was a huge swarm of mutated African Killer Bees from Brazil (The Bees from Brazil?) that has illegally immigrated to Texas and now threatens The World (or at least Houston, same thing).<p>Stirling Silliphant's script is so incredibly bad that some b-movie fans put forth that THE SWARM is really a snide parody of 50s mutant bug flicks instead of a serious thriller (check out Ken Begg's 50s schlock check list in his review of the movie at jabootu.com). Either way it does a real disservice to Arthur Herzog's fine novel, which succeeds in being frightening. The direction by Irwin Allen is lethargic, too often the movie just sits there when it should be moving at a mile a minute, but then again that allows the bad movie lover to sit there and savor each rancid morsel of dialog for all its cheesy glory. On the plus side Jerry Goldsmith contributes yet another fine score for a bad movie. Highly recommended and, believe it or not, this is an essential flick for bad movie lovers everywhere.

Producer/director Iwrin Allen was very disillusioned by the film's lack of success. The film only made $10 million dollars in box office revenue; that didn't cover the film's $21 million dollar budget! To this day, critics dislike the film. In its defense, one can see its influence on The X Files and cheesy movies made for the Sci Fi Channel. Aside from its flaws(plot holes, hammy acting, dubious scientific data, Michael Caine's over the top acting, etc.), the film has a so bad, it's good quality. The epic, sweeping, thumping music score by the late, great Jerry Goldsmith is hard to criticize. To paraphrase someone else, The Swarm is a yummy chunk of honey roasted cheesy entertainment and it's only recommended for brave souls!

Randall	review/helpfulness: 2/2	review/score: 3.0	review/time: 1025827200	review/summary: Campy, bad disaster movie that is surprisingly fun	review/text: "The Swarm" is merely another in the long line of 1970's disaster flicks that the Hollywood machine churned out with almost reckless abandon.  The difference here is that, instead of burning building or shaking ground, the disaster is a swarm of 'Africanized' killer bees that attack southern Texas with extreme ferocity.  While there is no doubt that killer bees do exist and are quite vicious when they attack, this particular swarm seems capable of doing things that not even the USSR could have imagined accomplishing.  These bees cause helicopters to crash, force passenger trains off the track, and... get this... cause a nuclear power plant to explode (!).  These are some pretty impressive bees.  For all the outlandishly ridiculous plot developments, "The Swarm" is still a fun movie to watch.  It's especially fun to watch actors of higher pedigree try to contend with this material.  On the one hand, there is Richard Chamberlain, an actor wants badly to be a better actor than the material he performs lets him be.  On the other hand, there is Oscar-winner, Michael Caine, who shows a propensity for choosing awful roles at the same rate as he chooses award-winning roles (how else can you explain a man who wins Academy Awards in such compelling films as "Hannah and her Sisters" and "The Cider House Rules", while also starring in such monumental turkeys as "Jaws: The Revenge" and "Beyond the Poseidon Adventure").  It's fun watching the two of them recite the dialogue of this movie and seeing them not smirk at what they're saying.  "The Swarm" is a bad, bad movie, but it has that extra bit of flair that allows it to be so bad it's good.

Yes, the special effects aren't all that great (they were no great shakes either in 1978), the cast is saddled with unusually lame dialogue supplied by Stirling Silliphant (basing the film on Arthur Herzog's novel of the same name).<p>All of that I will cheerfully agree to.  But the fact is that when I saw this film on TV once, I was very frightened by the bee attacks.  And let's look at it from a purely prophetic point of view: Because THE SWARM is not about European honey-bees but the far more agressive Africanized ones, this can be a terrifying movie if one looks past the so-so effects and the equally so-so script.  Those bees are among us now.  Maybe this film did more good than a lot of people expected.<p>Perhaps four stars is a bit much, but that's the rating I'd give to so prescient a horror/suspense film as this.

It didn't play very long in the theater, and I never rented it on VHS.  I knew it was going to be bad, but I decided to try it, figuring what the hell else is there to do in 2 1/2 hours?  It was one of the worst decisions of my life.  This is godawful.  There's no way you can recommend this to anyone.  Even Gen Xers, who seemed attracted to watching really bad movies and TV shows, would have a hard time enjoying this, in their terms, "ironically".  This is the extra long, "roadshow director's cut" that runs an interminable 156 minutes.  The film ran 114 minutes in the theaters, but they put this longer version on laserdisc.  Warner put the 156 version on the DVD, and we're stuck with it.  The performances are so badly over the top (especially Michael Caine and Slim Pickens) that you grimace and wished that you never rented this film.  Sure, there are many unintentional laughs, but it's not worth renting the film for.  There's even a silly romance between Fred MacMurray, Ben Johnson, and Olivia de Haviland that gets thrown in just to bore you even more.  The many guest stars should be ashamed of themselves, but these disaster epics were very hip in the 1970's.  It was one of those things where the celebrities of the day HAD to be in it (even then, celebrities had to be at the "hip" thing, no matter how awful it was).  The featurette is actually interesting.  It's kind of fun to listen to the actors talk about the horrible bees and how they were going to destroy the country (just like the Russian were going to invade and California was going to have a massive earthquake and fall into the ocean, two 1970's whoppers that never happened either).  It's great to watch Irwin Allen acting like Mr. Auteur, capturing his "vision".  Allen can make a decent film, like The Towering Inferno.  But this is just inexcusable.  There are boundless continuity flubs here.  My favorite has to be the next to last scene.  Richard Widmark, Michael Caine, and Katherine Ross are stuck in a high rise being attacked by bees.  The army is armed only with flame throwers, but that don't stop the bees.  The bees get Widmark (it's a spoiler, but I really hope you don't watch this, much less buy it), but somehow, Caine and Ross escape the building (we never find out how), and make it to an ocean shoreline where they destroy the bees.  Did they pinch a cab in the middle of the bee storm?  Or were the bees sleeping?  Anyway, in conclusion, don't buy this.  Please, don't buy this.

If only the film was as good as the cover....	review/text: As a child I was pen pals with one of the The Swarm's stars: Christian Juttner. Christian came up through the Disney farm team system (creating child actors). He's the only good thing in this miserable dreck. Don't get me wrong - he's over acting, but he isn't chewing up the scenery like so many others in this long, drawn out pot boiler/action film.<br /><br />Irwin Allen produced The Swarm. He also created "The Towering Inferno," "Earthquake," and "The Posiedon Adventure" among a vast list of low grade science fiction/action television series. Allen used a formula for each of his films/television series. He doesn't stray from it here.<br /><br />Michael Caine is at his most painfully horrible, overacting so badly he verges on a manic personality. Olivia DeHaviland embarrasses herself with a god-awful southern accent and overacts so badly she seems to be doing a skit impression of herself for an acting class on how NOT to act. Fred McMurray is saddled with dismal dialogue but doesn't actually embarrass himself.<br /><br />Allen throws us a bevy of A-List actors from the silver screen era, only to squander and waste them. The script is absolutely painfully bad. Nothing quite makes sense (not that this silliness could ever really make sense.<br /><br />Apparently, swarms of African Killer Bees has been sitting around procreating and mustering up the nerve to declare war on all of Texas (although only an idiot would not realize that the sets used are in the Hollywood Hills and backlots everywhere in Hollywood). What if these swarms were to get together and create one huge swarm? What indeed?!<br /><br />The opening of the film: a large group of men in orange mechanics overalls and orange motorcycle helmets wander around a military facility without uttering a word - this takes place over about twenty minutes. Apparently we are to understand that these boys in orange are the scientists and military personnel assigned to investigate a disaster: the military installation has been decimated by something....but what? The lab is quite obviously from Allen's television series: 20000 Leagues Under the Sea and Lost in Space. When they do speak, you wish they just shut up instead of uttering such drivel.<br /><br />Now, we are to believe that these bees kill quickly and efficiently leaving no tell tale signs of what killed the victims. First of all there would be huge welts on the victims and secondly there would be some dead bees (they tell us they've only discovered one bee carcass - I got news for you - if I'm getting stung by a swarm of bees, I'm still going to get in a few good slaps and take out more than zero bees).<br /><br />Christian Juttner's character is part of the first onscreen attack. His parents are killed as they set up for a picnic (thank heavens, because neither of them can act)- Juttner is mercifully spared because he was sent to the car for a thermos...<br /><br />He drives the car(covered in bees) into the backlot...um, I mean the nearby town and is whisked off to a hospital for treatment of his bites.  He later sneaks out with some friends and antagonizes the swarm of bees in the picnic area where his parents died. Then he runs around talking to Michael Caine and promises to watch over some woman Caine has taken a liking to. Next we see Juttner in bed in the hospital sick, dying, dead! Wow! Where did this come from?<br /><br />deHavilland agonizes as only a high school freshman acting student would over the deaths of dozens of school children in the playground (however never do we actually see a bee on any of these kids).<br /><br />No where in the film do we see any indication that bees have actually stung any victims. There are no welts, no marks, no redness. They're just .... dead. (I've actually been attacked by a hive full of hornets....let me tell you - they leave huge welts on you - all red, sore and painful).<br /><br />This film is great if you want really bad cinema. It is not even remotely good though.<br /><br />Please run ...and run quickly from ....The Swarm!

Anyone who says otherwise clearly hasn't seen the collected works of Jesus Franco or Andy Milligan. Or Woody Allen (only kidding!).<br /><br />Having exhausted the possibilities of the one-disaster-in-a-single-film subgenre (THE POSEIDON ADVENTURE, THE TOWERING INFERNO, FIRE!, FLOOD, etc.), producer-director Irwin Allen hired screenwriter Stirling Silliphant (IN THE HEAT OF THE NIGHT) to conceive a storyline in which several catastrophes occur within a broader narrative. Taking his cue from previous small-scale entries like THE DEADLY BEES (1966) and TERROR OUT OF THE SKY (1978), Silliphant concocted THE SWARM, an old-fashioned monster movie with an all-star cast, in which a huge mass of African killer bees rampage across America's south-west before descending on Houston, destroying everything in their path - including towns, trains, nuclear power plants, and the reputations of numerous high-profile actors.<br /><br />Representing the last gasp of the disaster cycle inaugurated in 1969 by Ross Hunter's big-time adaptation of Arthur Hailey's AIRPORT and popularized by Allen with respectable entries like the aforementioned POSEIDON and TOWERING (the latter a bona fide masterpiece), THE SWARM encapsulates this director's basic commercial ethos: Big stars, big set-pieces, and big drama. But Silliphant's script is so hokey in places, it's difficult to believe the writer wasn't deliberately mocking the entire scenario: Michael Caine is so obviously miscast (as a 'brilliant' entomologist), and so clearly contemptuous of the material, his expression never changes throughout the entire film, though Richard Widmark (whose career enjoyed a brief renaissance during the 1970's) gives it everything he's got as a gruff military type who's eager to quell the threat by bombing everything in sight. Henry Fonda rises above the fray as a dedicated immunologist, and Slim Pickens is quietly dignified in a brief appearance as a bereaved father, while Olivia De Havilland forms the centerpiece of a gentle romantic subplot (she's courted by Fred MacMurray and Ben Johnson). Richard Chamberlain, Lee Grant, Jose Ferrer, Bradford Dillman and Patty Duke Astin are featured in supporting roles alongside leading lady Katharine Ross, who seems particularly embarrassed by her ridiculous dialogue (get a load of her hysterical reaction to the death of a sympathetic younger character - if you lean forward, you can almost smell the ham!).<br /><br />Unfortunately, the home video version runs 155 minutes in length (expanded from the 116m theatrical print), which pads the narrative with pointless dialogue exchanges and routine soap opera melodramatics, turning a tightly constructed disaster thriller into an endless yak-fest. Whereas the theatrical print moved along at a fair old clip, this version slows everything down to a mild saunter, punctuated by a number of flamboyant visual fireworks. Allen stages the action sequences with a good deal of cinematic flair (despite poor photographic effects by industry veteran L.B. Abbott), but the movie's entertainment value is seriously compromised by needless padding.

These movies are the Cadillacs of the business.<br /><br />And then you've got "The Swarm" (1978), which along with "Meteor" (1979) and "When Time Ran Out" (1980) closed the door on the disaster craze for a while, and with good reason.  "The Swarm", though quite earnest in its theme, is probably about as bad as it gets for a movie regardless of genre.  That's what makes it so fun to watch.  Ostensibly, the stars of this movie are Africanized killer bees - millions of them that invade a US Air Force missile complex, terrorize a small town in the middle of its annual flower festival, then set their sights on the metropolis of Houston.<br /><br />It's up to Michael Caine, who plays a bee expert, to try to figure out how to lure these bees away so that people can live in peace again.  But if left up to a hard-nosed air force general played by Richard Widmark, and his right-hand man (Bradford Dillman), half the United States might get wiped out getting rid of the bees.  Katharine Ross is on hand as an air force doctor who ends up getting stung by bees, and Henry Fonda does his best as an aging bee expert to try to find an antidote to their stings.<br /><br />Of all the scenes in the movie, perhaps the funniest occurs when Richard Chamberlain, as one of Caine's peers, and Jose Ferrer, as the manager of a nuclear power plant not too far from Houston, die when bees overrun the plant and cause it to explode.  It marked the second time that the late great Irwin Allen killed off a Chamberlain character - he did it to Chamberlain in "The Towering Inferno" - but this time, he took over 36,000 other people with him!<br /><br />Also cranking up the cheese-meter is the ending, after which the producers thank the industrious and docile American honeybee for its contributions to our society.  I won't spoil what happens before the honeybee gets its props, but suffice it to say, you'll shake your head and go "are you kidding me?"  But that's what "The Swarm" is all about.  It's a serious topic turned silly, and it is so bad that it can't help but be good!

And while the premise is goofy fun, what makes "The Swarm" so enjoyable is the stellar cast.<br /><br />Michael Caine stars as renegade entomologist who has been tracking the bees. There is intense...and then there is Michael Caine intense. You have to love when Caine and Richard Widmark as an Air Force General begin chewing up scenery as to how to destroy the swarm. Henry Fonda drops in as one of Caine's hand picked scientists to help destory the bees, Slim Pickens has a quick cameo as a grieving father, Ben Johnson and Fred MacMurray (in his final role)fighting over the love of the local school marm played by Olivia de Havilland it cheese greatness at it's best. I think Ben Johnson is about the only cowboy who could wear a magenta suit and get away with it? Patty Duke, Richard Chamberlain, Jose Ferrer...I'm telling you this flick is filled with more stars than an entire season of "The Love Boat"!!<br /><br />In all honesty "The Swarm" is over-long, kind of dull and talky at times, but for some reason I still really enjoyed it. Go into the movie with tongue planted firmly in cheek and enjoy the epic goofiness.

It's the Air Force...not the Army. Secondly, Richard Chamberlain and Fred McMurray both DIED (Chamberlain at the nuclear powerplant, McMurray on the train).<br /><br />Yes, there were MANY technical flaws in the film. All the Irwin Allen disaster flicks (especially Towering Inferno) have gaffs in them. From day-to-night in the same scene, the plants on the outside of the upper floors of a high-rise building, among others, are absurd indeed.<br /><br />And, yes the cast of All-Stars & B-list actors did deserve a better script from Stirling Siliphant, the great writer of televsion shows such as the calssic Route 66, and Irwin Allen's first two disaster epics.<br /><br />However, I actually DID like Michael Caine's & Richard Widmark's performances. They made great "friendly adversaries"...the civilian scientist & the "warhawk" Air Force general.<br /><br />Overall, it was fairly entertaining, even with all the negatives.<br /><br />NOBODY will ever call this a classic, ala Poseidon Adventure or Towering Inferno, but it does have its moments.

Bees! Millions Of Beeeeees!"...	review/text: I grew up watching Irwin Allens TV shows, like LOST IN SPACE, TIME TUNNEL, VOYAGE TO THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA, and LAND OF THE GIANTS. His disaster epics: POSEIDON ADVENTURE and TOWERING INFERNO kept me well adhesed to the back of my theatre seat! With all of this to his credit, Allen made THE SWARM. Well, it's a hilariously inept bomb of a movie, with a two and a half hour running time! I kept praying for it's end credits to roll, while simultaneously being unable to tear my eyes from the horror before me! Dear God above, what a mess! Still, it is fun to watch in places; and the cavalcade of washed-up stars is wonderful! Examples: Former superstar, Henry Fonda in a wheelchair, either looking constipated or grimacing hysterically. Fred MacMurray (Double Indemnity) acting like he's still on the set of MY THREE SONS. Olivia De Havilland (Hush Hush Sweet Charlotte), bouncing around in a doomed traincar. Michael Caine (Dressed To Kill, The Hand) and Richard Widmark (COMA) screaming and yelling at each other for most of the film. Richard Chamberlain (Mr. Shogun himself) and Jos&eacute; Ferrer (The Sentinel, Blood Tide) doing their bee-covered  disco-dance-of-death in the nuclear power plant holocaust scene. Katharine Ross (The Stepford Wives, The Legacy, Donnie Darko) managing to look both stunning and stunned throughout. Lee Grant (Visiting Hours) as a nosy TV reporter who leaves her cameramen outside in the killer swarm, while taking refuge in the newsvan. Patty Duke Astin (Valley Of The Dolls) as a pregnant woman in mourning for her dead husband, oblivious to her doctor's ham-fisted advances. Bradford Dillman (Bug, Piranha, Chosen Survivors) as major what's-his-name. Cameron Mitchell (The Demon, Toolbox Murders) as the general who yells at Gen. Widmark and Dr. Caine. Yes, THE SWARM is a classic of disastrous proportions! This thing cost a fortune to make too! It was the end of Irwin Allen's reign as king of the blockbusters! It stands as a testament to what happens when producer / directors are given millions of dollars to run wild. Watch in amazement and awe...

Literally.  We have a distinguished cast..many of them Oscar winners including:  Henry Fonda, Olivia deHavilland, Jose Ferrer, Patty Duke, Lee Grant and Michael Caine.  Add to them Richard Widmark, Richard Chamberlain and Fred MacMurray and you would think we would have a film worthy of Irwin Allen and his ever present script writer Stirling Silliphant.<br />  The acting is horrible, not helped any by the static direction.  Only Henry Fonda rises above the horrible script.  Caine and Widmark also but to a lesser degree.  The rest of the cast founders...especially Katherine Ross, Patty Duke (in a thankless role as a pregnant widowed mother)and especially Olivia deHavilland who is a fine actress.  She was horrible in this film, just horrible.  (Pay close attention to her reaction in the scene where she peeks out of her school window and sees many children lying dead on the ground after having been stung by the bees. Any nominations for worst supporting actress that year????)<br />  This is by far Irwin Allen's turkey.  Nothing is believable here and one doesn't care if the bees are caught and eliminated or not.  One doesn't care period.  Always the hallmark of a bad movie.  This is a total stink bomb far beneath the talents of those who appeared in it.

During the 1970s, this director ruled Hollywood with several all-star, action packed disaster films. There was &quot;The Towering Inferno&quot; with Paul Newman and Steve McQueen. &quot;The Poseidon Adventure&quot; with Gene Hackman and Shelley Winters. The only one he wasn't associated with, I think, was &quot;Earthquake&quot; with Charlton Heston and George Kennedy. A cast of stars both major and minor populated constellation Irwin Allen. He could do no wrong-his films weren't masterpieces of cinematic art, but they drew in audiences willing to spend money to watch these epics. Then Allen made &quot;The Swarm,&quot; and a horribly swift silence descended over Hollywood. The 1978 film about a pack of civilization threatening killer bees should receive cult classic status from lovers of crud cinema. Where else are you going to see Henry Fonda inject himself with bee venom? Or Richard Widmark going down for the count while trying to stave off bees with a flamethrower? Say what you will about this film, and you could say plenty of terrible things about it, but it definitely falls under the &quot;so bad it's good&quot; category and thus deserves are attention.<p>Something's amiss at a missile silo somewhere in Texas. The military sends in a crack team of orange suited soldiers to discover what went wrong. It turns out a swarm of killer bees attacked the installation and killed all the personnel. General Slater (Widmark) arrives on the scene to supervise only to find Dr. Brad Crane (Michael Caine) strolling around the silo. Crane claims a swarm of deadly bees did the damage, a statement confirmed by a radar operator noticing something moving away at seven (!) miles an hour. A chopper sent up crashes when the bees attack (!!). Once the military defines the problem, Crane receives the go ahead from the president to take charge of the situation. He brings in all sorts of specialists, including world-renowned immunologist Dr. Krim (Henry Fonda) and the cranky Dr. Hubbard (Richard Chamberlain). Crane ramps up the hysteria by claiming that the bees will attack anyone in sight, including population centers. Sure enough, the focus jumps to a family picnic where we see Mom and Dad collapse under the weight of a thousand bee stings. Back at central control, Crane and Krim discover that a single bee sting is enough to kill a human being.<p>The situation rapidly deteriorates. The bees swarm through a town, ravaging the locals at will. A train full of evacuees derails as the killer insects attack with abandon. Hundreds die as Crane and an Air Force officer named Helena Anderson (Katharine Ross) try to find a solution out in the field. More problems emerge as the bees wipe out a nuclear power plant run by Dr. Andrews (Jose Ferrar) before moving on to Houston. Every solution the military attempts fails, including an effort to use flamethrowers to burn the bees out of the city. As Houston burns in the background, as ambulances crash through windows and blow up with the force of atomic bombs, Slater worries whether history will condemn him to the ash heap for what he has done. Crane offers one final idea, an idea that, if it works, could finally destroy the swarm once and for all. Barely escaping from the flaming wreck that is Houston, Crane and Anderson execute an intricate plot involving sound and helicopters. Fortunately, science again triumphs over the evil forces of nature. And not a moment too soon, I say.<p>Nothing works in &quot;The Swarm.&quot; Plot holes abound, so many that it is impossible to mention them all here. How did the bees get into an underground bunker and back out again without leaving any trace of their passing? If the swarm is such a threat, how come only one immunologist is working on finding a cure? Could bees really cause a train to derail? Questions without answers will constantly sidetrack your attention as you watch this film. Moreover, the performances from big name stars achieve a level of ridiculousness that is simply delicious to watch. Caine sleepwalks as Brad Crane, Ross looks like she's in a coma, and Widmark chews scenery without a thought to his future career. Allen throws in a bunch of ineffective and clich&eacute;d subplots, including a three way geriatric love triangle between Olivia de Havilland, Fred MacMurray, and Ben Johnson that ends in tragedy. Then there's the obligatory pregnant lady about to give birth (Patty Duke), and the altruistic self-sacrifice of Dr. Krim. Fonda's melodramatic final minutes are a marvel of hammy acting. Best line here? His vital signs are &quot;swinging from the norm to really spooky levels.&quot; Another personal favorite occurred when de Havilland's character, a school principal, witnesses a bunch of kids falling prey to the bees outside a building. She utters a hilarious groan of agony as she turns away from the window in horror. The movie, for some reason, shows this in slow motion. Are we supposed to be laughing this hard, Mr. Allen?<p>I could go on and on and on again about the hammy and ridiculous levels &quot;The Swarm&quot; achieves during its nearly three-hour runtime. I loved every minute of it, and am thinking about buying a copy of the film soon so I can roar with derision at my leisure. Sadly, the DVD doesn't have a lot in the way of extras. There is a short television style documentary about some of the stunt work in the film that in its own right is hilarious. You get to see Henry Fonda earnestly lecture the public on the real threat of killer bees, thereby implying that the over the top stuff in the movie could &quot;really happen.&quot; Pshaw, Henry! You ought to know better than that. Of course, I should have known better than to try and take this film seriously. A comedy classic!

The quality of the live stuff varies, some of it is shot on home video, while others are high quality professional mixes.  For example, a couple tracks from the Frog Brigade were taken straight from unused Bonnaroo footage.  If you have seen the first Bonnaroo dvd then you know what you're in for. Of particular note on this set are the two Frog Brigade tracks from 10/9/00 and the two CCBBB tracks from 9/16/02.  Both shows were supposedly taped to be released in entirety.  While it would be great to get those shows.. it's nice to see a few tracks at least make an appearence here. This set isn't for everyone, but if you can appreciate Les' more eccentric catalog and not just for his work with Primus, then it's a great purchase.  For the price you get a lot of material.

It is a great disk & I still recommend it, with some reservations.<br /><br />First, the costumes and on-stage antics are reminiscent of Frank Zappa (Baby Snakes (DVD), for example).  They are comical, and add to the incredible music that is made.<br /><br />Some of the footage appears to have been shot from someone's digital camera or a security camera in the building.  The footage and sound quality is quite bad in some performances, and makes me question the price I paid.  The available amount of good material does outweigh the bad, though.<br /><br />The bass fishing bits give an interesting human element to Claypool, however, they are much too long.  The candid interviews speak much more about him than watching some guy bob a fly in a creek somewhere.  Perhaps if they had decreased the number of "fishy takes the bait" routines, it would be more bearable.  Longer videos of his recording sessions would have been much better.<br /><br />Watching Claypool is entertaining, though, and inspires me to create, and get out the bass & practice.

That being said... a couple of things that would have good<br /><br />*More Oysterhead songs and not (in my opinion) one of the crappiest Oysterhead tracks (Shadow of a Man) por ejemple... Mr. Oysterhead, Oz is Everfloating, Army's on Ecstasy, and Radon Balloon.<br /><br />*I know I'm asking too much and being unreasonable when asking for a splash of Primus...oh well..haha (too much awesome Primus to fill one dvd)<br /><br />That being said I enjoyed the DVD quite a lot and still going back constantly JUST to watch Long in the Tooth (standing bass both different and magical!) Also if you are unfamiliar with Les's side projects...this gives you a new appreciation and will definently broaden your horizons (C2B3 awesome stuff)<br /><br />Didn't get the 5th star due to lack of Oysterhead tracks (and if you're looking for primus footage don't buy this DVD for there is none to be found, except for quick little clips in the "bass fishing the world" segment (which is great if you want to see some great Les interview footage)

With his incredible skills, eclectic musical tastes, experimental work and sheer love of (as he says) "music for music's sake", he is the closest thing we have to what Zappa was doing in the 1960s & 70s; pushing the boundaries of what music can be as a pure art form.<br /><br />BUT THIS DVD PISSES ME OFF!! In fact......the only other thing I can think of that pissed me off this much, but I still loved, was a WOMAN!!!!:)<br /><br />But I have to admit that my anger is caused by pure opinion - I think the song selection SUX!! Every one of his CDs has much better songs to choose from. For the Frog Brigade, well what can I say except that even the people in the audience on one of the videos were asking for "Cosmic Highway", my personal favorite from the Brigade. Oh well, at least we got "Ding Dang" and a killer version of "Wham-Ola"!!!<br /><br />As for Oysterhead - Why do we only get one song and it's (personal opinion again) one of the worse songs on the whole CD? It's obviously the same show that was broadcast on HBO, so where's "Mr. Oysterhead" and/or the magnificent "Pseudo Suicide"?!?<br /><br />As for C2B3, well, not including "Buckethead" is, to me, nothing short of sacrilegious!!! Another one I would have liked to see is "Ignorance is Bliss". At least we got "Scott Taylor"!!<br /><br />And another thing (that I have frequently mentioned on reviews of other DVDs) is that the mere fact of what's on this DVD proves that there is some great concert footage out there!! Come on Les, how about an entire show on DVD? Those 1st 2 Frog Brigade cds (Live Frogs I &II), the ones that were recorded at the Great American music hall in San Fran? Well, considering that "Running the Gauntlet" is obviously the exact same track as the one on Vol I means that those shows were filmed!!!! So you know what that means......somewhere out there is video of them performing Pink Floyd's "Animals" in its entirety, "Shine on you Crazy Diamond" and all the other great stuff that's on vol one!! And while the Frog brigade is always good, nothing beats that first incarnation!<br /><br />So bottom line...if you're a Claypool fan and don't already have this - what are you waiting for?? (Mostly) great sound and video, and a good visual record of all the different stuff he's been doing since Primus ended (the 1st time!) But let's all start lobbying him to start releasing complete concerts; he really ought to make all this stuff available, thru his website at least!!! I would especially like to see the aforementioned Frog brigade stuff, the complete Oysterhead concert and the C2B3 show from 9/29/04.<br /><br />How about it Les? You know your fans will support you and Trey "Antipasta's" fans would be all over the Oysterhead show in a heartbeat!!

Get your camp in order Les.<br /><br />The state of music major bummer today, Bass Players of his caliber are rare, but nope I am not going to see this show in Dec 06 when they hit my town, been twice to Primus already, I always give people 2 chances.  just a bunch of noise and sounds like 3 guys that keep running into each other and falling down.  no grove like Frog B and Oyserhead.  But then, Les is the man in Primus, he doesnt have to worry/deal with other egos, he is the Alpha in Primus.  Egos, feeds us all huh?

I absoluetly love the acting, story, setting, and gore. George Romero's finest. I will not be reviewing the movie but the 4 disc uliimate edition, which is the only way to own this movie. Before I was aware of this set, I owned the anchor bay version, with the theatrical version and no special features, then I found out about this. The anchor bay version cost me 20$, and the ultimate edition was 25$, well worth the extra 5$. This set is packaged nicely with tons of amazing artwork, it contains a sample of the dawn of the dead grapic novel. This set has four discs,one for each of the three versions of the film, and one for special features. I will now be reviewing the three versions. Theatrical: what I originally saw, great mix of score, fast paced and the film that everybody loves. Extened: added nothing important, made the film way more boring, not recommended Eurpopean: my faourite version, better music making it more supsensful, way more gore, and extremely fast paced, the best version. Special Features: two main documebtaries, both extremely good and informative, a great addition to the set. Overiew: A great edition of a great movie, bursting with special features, a nicely desingned case with plenty of artwork, three versions of the film, and the grapic novel sample as an enjoyable bonus. A MUST BUT FOR ANY DAWN OF THE DEAD FAN... THE ONLY VERSION TO OWN...AND A GREAT PRICE!!!!!!!

This was made in a different environment to todays movie scene. It was radical for it's day and it changed things. IT was also a hit at the cinemas. Audiences went to it in droves. That's the truth. NOw there are three versions of this one. the first is called 'zombie' the europeon cut of this one, then the long directors cut which is on a double sided dvd and it was one of the first dvd's ever put out! The other is the theaterical cut which is on the blu ray. Which looks great by the way. It has little in the way of extras though.

I realize that it may seem dated, but it holds a very important point...the undeniable despair of the 4 souls whose efforts at reclaiming a world that has become so changed...why bother? But it is their efforts which guide them and still, they are dramatically left to pursue whatever life has left for them as livelihood. Unfortunately, there are others who want to create their own superflous banter and hedonism which spoil their plans. What would you fight for? The moral of the story is to stay ALIVE..no matter what the cost! And this film shows a very "real" side of people, who react just as if they were "alive" and we are left to see how they destroy each other, especially in death.

I'm a big Day of the Dead fan, but Dawn is the greatest, hands down.  There are many emotions and concepts and thoughts this movie invokes:  the childish "what if I were the only person left on earth and I could shopping-spree the mall!?" and the ideas about humanity feeding on itself, Romero's theme of consumerism and greed that had consumed America in the 70's and 80's, suvival, relationships, friendships, you name it. This movie kicks butt.<br /><br />Ken Foree is amazing as Peter. His delivery was outstanding as the badass muscle that ends up being full of humanity and courage.  David Emgee as "Flyboy" Stephen, awesome.  Gaylen Ross did a tremendous job conveying a sense of sadness, emptiness, and loss amidst trying to continue her relationship pregnant and in a world of despair.  Roger, played by Scott H. Reiniger was probably my favorite character.<br /><br />The best dialogue of the whole film?<br /><br />"Francine Parker: They're still here.<br />Stephen: They're after us. They know we're still in here.<br />Peter: They're after the place. They don't know why, they just remember. Remember that they want to be in here.<br />Francine Parker: What the hell are they?<br />Peter: They're us, that's all, when there's no more room in hell.<br />Stephen: What?<br />Peter: Something my granddad used to tell us. You know Macumba? Voodoo. My granddad was a priest in Trinidad. He used to tell us, "When there's no more room in hell, the dead will walk the earth."<br /><br />I love the character studies of the Dead Trilogy, how humanity comes together or falls to pieces in a crisis and how much actual humanity is retained. Good stuff!<br /><br />If anybody tells you these zombie flicks are just blood and guts, they're nuts.<br /><br />One last item:  look for the guy in the biker gang who is SO STUPID that he puts his arm in the cuff of a bloodpressure testing machine WHILE the zombies are storming the mall!  This cat earns the stupidest human being in history award!

He captures George Romero setting up shots, and make-up artist Tom Savini<br />whipping up zombie effects.<br /><br />Another great extra is a tour of the mall where the film was shot. Ken Foree, who played one of the SWAT team<br />members, leads a group of fans through various shooting locations.<br /><br />The discs are housed in an attractive slipcase with minimal artwork. I highly recommend this item for any hardcore<br />zombie fan. You will not be disappointed.

Morales	review/helpfulness: 1/1	review/score: 5.0	review/time: 1296950400	review/summary: You can't mess with a classic	review/text: The original Dawn of the Dead didn't make a big splash when it was released over 30 years ago, but over time society found out its true value. This 4 disc special edition is really the only one to get when it comes to this film. Featuring all 3 versions of the film plus a loaded documentary disc, this is one fans should NOT be without. For those who don't know, DOTD is about a world where zombies have overrun society, and while there are a slew of survivors all over the world, the point has come where life as we know it will come to an end. While the original Night of the Living Dead that was released in 1968 featured a world where zombies were the minority, this film picks up years later where zombies have taken over the majority of society, and whoever is left must fend for themselves. The movie focuses on 4 survivors who take refuge in a shopping mall and try to make a new life there, meanwhile later in the film tensions spikes as they know they cannot be comfortable forever and must fend off invaders.<br />Aside from great effects, fantastic over the top (for its time) gore, and an underlying statement about our zombified society, what really makes DOTD shine is its characterization. All 4 main characters are built up throughout the film and you begin to really care about them; the life they start to make in the shopping mall makes one wonder if they would do the same. George Romero has always had a touch for building good characters and this film is no exception. Critically acclaimed and arguably the GREATEST horror movie ever made (in my personal opinion, it absolutely is), this is one that no fan should be without and no avid horror fan should pass up.<br /><br />Disc 1 includes the U.S. Theatrical version, which actually is George Romero's preferred version, running at 127 minutes you'll get the most well-balanced version of the film available. Includes all the gore and blood that was meant to be in theaters, as well as the genius soundtrack.<br /><br />Disc 2 is the full extended version of the film which adds 12 minutes to the original length, running at 139 minutes. While the soundtrack to this version is the same, the movie features extra scenes but at times can just feel a tad too long; still though, because the movie itself is so great one wouldn't mind sitting in an extra 12 minutes. For me personally this is MY preferred version, but contrary to popular opinion, this is NOT the version George Romero himself prefers.<br /><br />Disc 3 is the European cut of the film, and seems to be mostly everyone's LEAST cared for version of the film. And for good cause. The movie runs 118 minutes long and the soundtrack is greatly reworked for the European audience, featuring somewhat stranger ideas in terms of musical tension that comes in the form of funny synth sounds that while still workable, still takes away greatly from the original soundtrack which featured zombies walking and moaning to goofy "carnival-like" music that really made George Romero's "zombie nation" statement applicable and note-worthy. Furthermore, in this version, the ending is simply a black screen with credits, whereas in the other versions, credits were atop more zombie "pranks" with the same carnival type of music, that while on the surface sounds goofy, it still gave the film a pretty creepy touch that gets you smirking on the outside, while feeling a bit uncomfy on the inside.<br />The European version of this film is basically cut to make this more of a straight out action film rather than a psychological spine tingler that the other versions were so good at being. Classic director Dario Argento remade this version to appeal to European audiences, and while it does the job, more art-film enthusiasts may be turned off by it's almost complete lack of psychological creepiness.<br /><br />Disc 4 features 4 different documentaries that fans of this film will absolutely pine over. 2 features are over an hour long each in length, and contain FULL cast and production team interviews all these years later, therefore it's VERY fun to see where all these actors are and how they've aged (may I say that the female protagonist of this film, Gaylen Ross, still looks just as gorgeous as she did 30 years ago! Wow!), including George Romero himself. Plus 2 shorter features that are home video shot, one featuring some cast members and zombies (the actors from way back when) going to the actual mall where the film was shot, as well as home videos made during the production of this film. All in all, the documentary feature gives fans a greatly detailed influx of info on this grand horror masterpiece.<br /><br />At this price, it's an easy decision, if you're already a fan of the film, you owe it to yourself to add this to your cart IMMEDIATELY. And for those who have never seen the film, for the price listed this is one buy that will absolutely not let you down.

We didn't really know what to expect from it, other than we knew it is a cult classic. During the opening scenes, there were two things that were evident. One, the movie looks like it was filmed last week! Beautiful! The other, we thought maybe we had made a mistake because of the way the movie opens with a bunch of hectic scenes. Those fears soon subsided as the story starts to get going and we learn who the characters are that we are supposed to care about. Other than the odd opening, I'd have to say that this is my all-time favorite zombie movie, by far. But it's the quality of the remaster that really impressed me. The only movies I've seen that look this good for their age are the frame-by-frame remasters of the James Bond series. It was really hard to believe that this was a movie from 1978. It's about as close as you can get to going back in time. If you like zombie movies and haven't seen this one, you need to see it. NOW! :) This version's quality far outweighs its price.

Now I'm talking about the original, of course.  George Romero once again delivers a great zombie movie.  It stars David Emge, Ken Foree, Scott H. Reiniger, Gaylen Ross, and Tom Savini.<br /><br />Basically the movie is about some unknown pandemic that causes flesh-eating zombies to emerge.  This phenomena spreads throughout the U.S.  Four survivors hide in a shopping mall and find themselves fighting the zombies.  The movie is extremely gorey.  Extremely bloody.  It has great special gore effects by special effects guru Tom Savini, who also appears in the movie.  You'll see blood splatter everywhere.  Lots of gunfire.  Lots of violence.<br /><br />The zombies are very basic looking.  The vast majority of them just have their faces painted with grey or blueish-grey makeup.  Since the movie had a budget of only about $650,000 and there were SO MANY zombies, this basic makeup had to do.  Besides that, there was no such thing as CGI back in 1978.  Had there been CGI, the zombies would have looked more realistic, but I'm not a fan of CGI for the most part.<br /><br />This DVD has some good special features.  It's in widescreen format and is remastered in 5.1 DTS & Dolby Digital Surround Sound.  It also has audio commentary from writer and director George Romero, assistant director Chris Romero, special makeup effects artist Tom Savini, and is moderated by Perry Martin.  Also included are the theatrical trailers, TV spots, radio spots, poster and advertising gallery, a bio on George Romero, and a comic book preview.<br /><br />If you like extremely violent zombie movies, then this George Romero classic should entertain you.  It's not a Halloween-ish kind of zombie movie, but it's highly entertaining nevertheless.

It's more than a zombie movie, but a movie with a deeper meaning. With the Blu-ray, the video quality is better than ever before. But with the clarity, the zombies look more blue than green. It's not a big problem but is sort of funny when you start watching it. Special features are nice but not special. They are good for a boring day or if you're really into what they are talking about. Overall I give the Blu-ray a 4 out of 5.

This Blu-ray version looks and sounds great, with a casual but lively and informative audio commentary by Romero, Tom Savini, and Christine Romero (who I guess is George's ex-wife now, as he mentions his girlfriend on the commentary track for Diary of the Dead). This is all wonderful, and the only thing that keeps me from giving this edition 5 stars is the fact that only the U.S. theatrical version is included. I try to keep only one version of each movie I own, but I'm going to have to keep my regular DVD release of Dawn as well as the Blu-ray version because the regular DVD release includes the Cannes cut and the Argento cut along with the U.S. theatrical version. I realize that this is Romero's preferred version, but with such a landmark film, I want to own the alternative versions as well. If you're not interested in the variant versions, consider this a 5 star rating.

But I think what Romero<br />introduced that got him the credit was the zombie's<br />cannibalistic need of living parts, be it flesh or brains<br />along with the disease factor of if you get bitten alive<br />you'll end up walking dead like them. It also didn't<br />hurt to be one of the first films to have a multi-racial<br />cast featuring an African-American as group leader<br />which of course in '68 was pretty rare indeed. Yeah,<br />Night Of The Living Dead deserves this honor even if<br />technically it isn't quite true.<br /><br />But it wasn't until almost ten years later Romero<br />really put the zombie in pop-culture with the much<br />heralded Dawn Of The Dead in 1978. This film took<br />the trapped survivor scenerio of NOTLD up a notch by<br />putting in the more modern day setting of a typical<br />American pleasure, the indoor shopping mall. DOTD,<br />while offering pretty much the same living character<br />design, this time made the zombies more in number,<br />appearance, and graphic actions. It was this film with<br />instead of it's shades of gray now bursting in bloody<br />color that put the Zombies on the map permanently.<br />It's a great film that not only fleshes out the characters<br />at a good pace (though at times it does seem a little<br />too detailed in that department), but truly shown that<br />zombism has no cultural bounds. Not only did the Americans<br />just eat up this new genre, but on the opposite side of the world, Europeans did so even more, especially the film-making members of Italy.<br /><br />When Romero wanted his film to be presented over there,<br />he enlisted the help of Italian filmaker Dario Argento to<br />re-edit it for Italian audiences. Argento slimed down bits<br />of comedy & slower dialouge, gave it a faster soundtrack, and<br />changed it's name to Zombi. This may have been one of the<br />most important effects this film ever could of have. Not only was the film an even bigger success overseas, but it inspired many<br />Italian filmmakers to continue what Romero started. Before<br />Romero even thought of his 1985 third installment Day Of The Dead, Italian director Lucio Fulci brought a year later his unofficial (yet honored by Romero himself) sequel called Zombi 2. This film showed what the worldwide Zombie outbreak was doing half a world away from that mall. But this time the zombies were far more graphic and the gore and pacing were turned up by leaps & bounds. It was this film along with Dawn that gaveway for the Italian Zombie craze of the 1980's. Like how the Italians created their own successful version of the classic American Western ten years earlier, they once again did it but with our Zombies. What followed was a barrage of great Zombie films that never seemed to be carbon copies of Romero's then two classics, but new ways of defining the genre. Unfortunately by '85 with Day Of The Dead, Romero seemed to be beaten at his own game by them with Day's lackluster audience response (though over time, it in itself has become the classic it deserves). But all of this couldn't of happened without Romero & his original update of Dawn Of The Dead. It was that film that launched a thousand ships filled with the living dead.<br /><br />...And now a review of the 2004 DVD Ultimate Edition Anchor Bay release:<br /><br />Without a doubt, this is one of the most exhaustive releases any one film has ever received, and it's completely deserved. The film that started the Zombie craze that still lives to this day, gets an amazing FOUR disc set that shows you every little piece of it's history and formations. With this set you get THREE different versions of the film: the US theatrical, the extended Directors Cut, and the rare Dario Argento European cut known as Zombi. Each version has it's own merit and differences that never, ever feels like release overkill. All has been fully remastered to the hilt, with different commentaries for each equally entertaining (though it would have been nice to have an Argento one for the European cut). No lack of movie presentation here, you get it all.<br /><br />Extras? Wow, you got them! Documentaries, commercials, trailers, stills, photos, home movies, easter eggs, Jeez this thing is packed! In fact, I couldn't even think of what it's missing. All enclosed in a great box-set with wonderful artwork and an errie front cover to boot. C'mon, it even comes with a comic book, for cryin' out loud! Now I know Anchor Bay/Starz is known for double-dipping their audience, but it has never been as necessary as this one. If you own any of their previous releases, sell them and add it to the pot to get this. Something of this quality to me has only been seen for a franchise, not a single film release, so you can tell just how impressive this set is. So if you're a fan of any level to the original Dawn Of The Dead, or the genre of Zombies itself, your collection is NOT complete till you own this. I personally have never given a DVD release a full 10 before, and I feel once you get this you might do the same.

That's what it's all about.<br /><br />This is IMO the finest horror film of the 20th Century, and I've watched a lot of them, believe me.  Also the finest George Romero has ever done.  If you have a strong stomach and an active mind, this movie is for you.  The only complaint I'd have is I've watched an unabridged version and seen a couple moments edited out of this one.  On the + side, there are a lot of interviews etc. on this version that are definite additions.<br /><br />For those interested in a more literary sense, it's really an allegory comparable to Orwell's "Animal Farm,"  a story about American society and corruption resulting from greed.  It's also a period piece, inasmuch as its setting is the lone survivors of a plague take refuge in a shoppng mall, back when shopping malls were a new thing (imagine that!).<br /><br />But if you don't care bout that literary mumbo-jumbo, the movie is still horrific and full of classic horror moments.  There is not a movie like this out there now, and not likely to be again, AFAIK.<br /><br />--There is only one detractor to this DVD version worth mentioning, and it's a big one.  If possible you should definitely get the uncut version, ro perhaps an "editor's version" of this, since the "American Theatrical Release" version had small but significant parts censored.  They were mostly little parts portraying the government in a bad light, imagine that.

It is also spine-chillingly funny, making blunt comparisons between the dead-eyed, gore-loving zombies and vapid American consumers. (Next time you're at a mall, the impression will be hard to shake.) But for all its satirical wit, "Dead" also features riveting action sequences, culminating in the final showdown involving soldiers, bikers, and endless waves of the undead. Tom Savani's ghoulish effects are not for the faint of heart, so be sure you're in the mood for explicit slaughter.

You can see really see the blood sweat and tears that went through this dvd by looking at the cover. This review will mostly refer to the dvd, i don't have to explain what a cult classic this horror movie is. This is deff. the landmark of all zombie flicks. you zombie fans know that!! Enough said, the moment I popped in the first disc i was blown away by the transfer. The Dts. 5.1 surround sound really gives the movie a great boost. From every zombie moan to every bullet being fired, my speakers turn my room into a mall! (Slight exaggeration) There is very little grain even the night shots are pretty decent. As for the second disc (directors cut), which iv been waiting for years to see is simply amazing. Although the director's cut is only a 2.0 surround sound it still is stunning to see the 139 minute master piece. The special features on the first and second disc are weak but hey thats what the BONUS DISC is for right? On the director's cut there are some actual commericials from the Monroeville mall in the late 70's in case your interested. The commentary is pretty solid too, with DVD producers Richard P. Rubinstein and Perry Martin. I personlly like the commentary on the first disc with Make up master Tom Savini and the King of horror himself George A. Romero. You also get a comic book preview. Now for disc three, (European version) You get the cast commentary with Ken Foree, Scott H. Reiniger, and Gaylen Ross. The sound presented in this European version has good quality, 5.1 surround sound, 2.0 dolby surround, or the simple original mono. Picture wise, the transfer is decent. The special features are good too, you get all the international tv. spots, trailers, artwork, ect. You get the idea... Now for disc four, The Dead will walk Documentary is quite stunning, you get amazing interviews with just about everyone involved on the set of Dawn of the dead, on top of that you get the original documentary, you also get to look at home movies from zombie extra Robert Langer, the best part on the 4th disc is deff. the Monroeville Mall tour by the big man himself Ken Foree, Ken Foree makes the tour entertaining and keeps it brief. The packaging is amazing as well, you get an actual Dawn of the dead Comic book along with a good solid insert on all 4 discs. Overall one of the best movies and dvd packages of all time from Anchor Bay. A must buy!

I have seen all types of horror movies and have always been totally "in love" with any movie meant to scare a person.  I always find something to appreciate in a horror movie.<br /><br />That being said, I would like to state that this is BY FAR, the BEST horror movie ever made.  I'm a little different than most "Dawn of the Dead" fans.  I just saw the movie this year(2004) for the first time and actually saw the re-make(also excellent, but in a different sense) first.  In fact, I liked the re-make so much, that I went out and bought the original immediatly.<br /><br />This movie is great for so many reasons, I can hardly even begin.<br /><br />First, this movie contains some of the finest acting you will EVER see in a horror movie.  All of our characters are played by "no-name" actors, but they are far from bad and actually really good at making the viewer feel what the characters themselves are actually feeling.<br /><br />Second, the plot is absolutly fantastic.  "Night of the Living Dead" was great.  I've seen it a million and a half times, since I was about five.  The movie contains a basic plot and it would have been very easy for Romero simply to continue that story, but with a different set of characters.  Oh no, not Romero.  He does give us a new set of characters(mainly because the originals die in "Night") and he does pick up the story close to when "Night" ends, BUT now we have some pretty comlpex side-plots going on.  We have a pregnant women; a black man, who is not wanted with the group at first and who also just killed another cop for barging into a project and shooting innocent people.  We have a "hot-shot" who feels he is "untouchable".  Basically, we have the world shortly after the zombie attacks have taken place.  We have people on TV, trying to explain why this is happening, when the funny thing is, who would be watching TV at a time like that????? But that is the effect that Romero is getting at.  He touches on issues similiar throughout the movie.<br /><br />The gore in this movie is fantastic for the time it was shot.  Nowadays, it would be considered "cheesy" and I actually read another person's review here at amazon, stating that he found it cheesy.  GET A CLUE.  That same person also recommends watching "The Exorcist" or "A Nightmare on Elm Street" because this was not scary enough.  GIVE ME A BREAK, what in the world is scarier that the possiblilty of being secluded with 3 strangers in a world that has been taken over by zombies???<br /><br />I love a "Nightmare on Elm Street", but please don't compare this movie to that.<br /><br />Seriously, and not to sound too cliche, the worst part about this movie is that it ends.  I wish it were like 7 hours longs, because it is so much fun to watch.<br /><br />In conclusion, I know this review is probably very rambled and out-of-order, but when it comes to this movie, I am just get way too excited and can't stop talking.  There are so many more things I would like to say about this movie, but just can't think of.  All in all, if you are going to see or buy only 1 horror movie, buy this one!

Estes	review/helpfulness: 1/1	review/score: 5.0	review/time: 1098921600	review/summary: Nothing Beats The Tried & True Original.	review/text: Picking up three weeks after the events in "Night Of The Living Dead," the sequel "Dawn Of The Dead" has the undead now overpopulating normal civilization. The military has ran out of ideas and every man seems to have a different idea about what to do and where to go. Throughout all this chaos, two S.W.A.T. team members (played by Scott H. Reiniger and the great Ken Foree) meet up with two television station employees (Gaylen Ross and David Emgee) and take shelter in a nearby shopping mall. Despite an incredible amount of the undead population flocking to the mall at an alarming rate, the foursome find salvation in a top-level storage space, and turn what was originally supposed to be a resting stop, into a long-term stay. However, like all societies sooner or later, the one created above the mall full of zombies begins to crumble piece by piece as the movie forges on. All four actors play their roles perfectly, and the characters conflict and compliment each other very well. Director George Romero ("Night Of The Living Dead") is very subtle and lets the story play out naturally. Although his message of anti-consumerism is a bit dated, he still manages to make the movie and the story timeless. Despite the undead being very slow, there is still a thick amount of dread and suspense piled on. There is a reason why Romero is the grandfather of zombie flicks. The zombies aren't the scary part of this movie. What is scary are the people, and how they react to the situation they are faced with, and how quickly society begins to crumble. But it doesn't hurt that special effects master Tom Savini (who, incidentally directed the remake of "Night Of The Living Dead") piles on healthy servings of gore at all the right moments (also, look out for him as the leader of the gang that breaks into the mall). The original "Dawn Of The Dead" is easily one of the best horror movies ever made, and is the rare case of a sequel being just as good as the original. It also works so that if you haven't seen "N.O.T.L.D." you can still watch this and know what's going on. The remake is good, but nothing will ever top this one. This is a movie that will stay in your head for days, and will never ever leave your subconcious. If you're looking for an intelligent and brave horror flick, go to the mall. "Dawn Of The Dead" is highly recommended.

Every fan should buy this set today! The Dawn of the Dead Ultimate set is awesome for any George Romero fans. This 4 Disc set in widescreen format contains hours of zombie watching. The box is done in black and the inserts were nice.  On the first disc you get to see the Dawn of the Dead we saw in theaters. There are also cool commentaries and trailers which I missed the first time it came out. There's some interesting stuff with a gallery thing they had showing a comic preview and some stuff about Romero. There is also some other stuff on the first disc that I didn't get to yet but I will. The second disc has the extended stuff which made it so worth getting the set for me. It's not like seeing a new movie but it was nice. There is some commentary by the producer in this one and some more gallery stuff with prodction stills and etc. The third disc contains the European Version which was shorter than the U.S. version we all saw, or at least the one I saw and loved. At this point of watching the dvd set I was turing into a zombie myself. A happy zombie I point out. The most interesting things on this disc were the UK tv ad for the film and the commentaries. There was some more gallery stuff which I still haven't yet watched because I wanted to save a little something for later. The fourth disc contains featurette Monroeville Mall tour with George Romero on set home movies with commentary from Robert Langer, document of the dead and the dead will walk. The video quality and audio quality throughout this film was amazing. I can't believe they did such a good job with the tranfer. There are a nice amount of extras to make most fans happy. Unlease the zombie in you and get this set says the cookie. If you haven't seen this film before you might want to rent it first but not fans.

Previously, the cinematography in Romero's landmark film has always looked a bit dull and bland to me but here it really shines with a new lease of life. The colours are rich and the contrast level is spot on.<br /><br />The newly added DTS mix is excellent although not very directional - I suppose the aim was not to stray too far away from the original.  My one gripe with the film itself is the helicopter zombie sequence - it looks ridiculous - anyone else think it looks like Oddbod from Carry on Screaming?<br /><br />Keep 'em coming Anchor bay.

Dead people are coming back to life as flesh eating zombies and no one really has any idea why. A small group of survivors, including a mall cop and a couple of news reporters, finds a refuge from the terror by boarding themselves up in a shopping mall. Zombies begin flocking to the mall in droves, but have no way of entering. Giving in to their every whim and desire, the group settles down to a fairly comfortable existence until a roving motorcycle gang finds out they have a helicopter. The motor gang has no desire to move in and live in the safety of the mall, but wants everything for their own. Their invasion of the mall brings about the film's climatic finish.<br /><br />Though the movie is fairly graphic and is a zombie flick, it's actually more of a commentary on materialism and consumerism and how it affects and infects all of us. As a commentary, the film is almost brilliant. As a zombie movie, DAWN OF THE DEAD set the bar for almost every other zombie movie to come. However, DAWN OF THE DEAD is also a movie and as a movie, it has a lot of faults. Like a Charles Dicken's novel, just about everything interesting or worthwhile that happens, occurs near the beginning and end of the movie. The middle, which should be the meat of the movie, doesn't contain much substance and the long commentary on our culture goes on too long. Nevertheless, even though the film isn't for the squeemish, DAWN OF THE DEAD is worth watching if your a fan of zombie or horror movies. Also, it's a movie that film buffs should watch just because there are very few horror films that are made that have a social context as deep as a Romero film and DAWN OF THE DEAD is one of the best.

This is a cleaned DVD, polished so you can see every blue zombie, and every gut splitting second. This DVD has many special &quot;SPECIAL&quot; features like hidden easter egg interviews of Chris Romero (wife) and Tom Sivina (FX). If you are a collector and dont have this virson, buy it! IT SHINNY! But if you never seen the original Dawn of the Dead...DONT! Do not buy this DVD unless you want to be left out, it may be cleaned, it may have extras, but its bad! Why?....because its cut! Cut?!?! what do you mean? On the back it says is longer, yah but not in the wat you think! This dvd does not feature the docking bay scene with Josef Pilato as the police officer and also cuts cool scenes that are funny and bloody. THIS IS A THEATER VERSION!!!!! meaning some guts are not included. They cut cool scene and extanded room scenes (a.k.a. &quot;PANIC&quot; scenes). These are the begining scenes in which every one panics! They extend the camera scenes and show more, like the computers and peoples reactions. Ken Foree and Scott Reiniger make this move great! But I still must say, only buy this if! IF your collecting this kind of stuff or this is your only chance to see it. But there are 2 main reasons I still must say do not buy, if you never saw this Dawn of the Dead...<p>1.) ITS EDITED!!!!(a.k.a. cut)<p>2.) There will be a special edition 3 disk DVD box set for Dawn of the Dead, featuring DAWN (78), DAWN (04), and zombi. And later on there will be a DEAD BOX SET, that will have Night(68),Night(98),Dawn(78),Dawn(04),Zombi,Zombi 2,Day(85),zombi3,zombi4,zombi5, and more!!!<p>NOW, its up to you to decide to buy it or not...or you could wait untill September/October.

The only difference is its taking place in the U.S. (take note of the various cameos of some of the original cast members)So in my humble opinion, the original is by far worth your money. The premise: A traffic Reporter along with his girlfriend and two cops fly a helicopter out of Philly and land on a zombie infested suburban Pittsburgh mall. They clear it out and live it up a while (who wouldnt) living out every Americans fantasy. Then some bikers come and crash the party and they have to defend their claim. A classic examination of Americas' love of out of control consumerism, at the same time taking note of how savage mankind can be in a time of peril (the apartment raid in the beginning is a prime example. Basic human rights and dignity is non-existent, primarily to the government and law enforcement)This film also captures the horror and mass confusion of the situation and effectively conveys this throughout the beginning of the film. Although the zombies are kind of a second rate nuisance more or less (slow, bumbling etc.) they are still a force to be reckond with. decent acting all around, a must see Romero film that still holds up to this day.

It's good marketing, and the wait simply means the box is going to be that much better. Granted, we've been waiting a good long time for Anchor Bay to release their end-all-to-end-all box set, but if we get everything available, it should be worth the wait.<p>This is the 128 minute US Theatrical cut of the film, featuring what Romero felt was the best runtime, a good ballance between the gore, comedy, and character development, with the 'complete' score by The Goblins. The 139 min. version was rushed together to play at the Cannes Festival in 1978, and as such, is simply an extended rough cut. I'm personally glad that Romero can honestly state he likes a tighter, shorter version of his own film. If only most others could do the same, we wouldn't have to own each of their movies 10 times over - but, so is the game of &quot;Director's Cuts&quot;. Remember, 'longer' doesn't always mean 'better', though it certainly can.<p>I'm personally hoping that the 3 DVD set coming in the fall will include Argento's &quot;Zombi&quot; cut, the Theatrical cut, and a whole lot of extras (Document of the Dead, maybe? I don't think Synapse has it anymore.), making it work with the single DVD rather than against it, but we'll just have to see.<p>I don't know what I can say about the film that hasn't been said before; excellent film, funny and action packed, holds it's own against the current dreck like Resident Evil and House of the Dead without even trying. The new Dawn, while not a total thrashing of the original (like, say, the new Texas Chainsaw Massacre), simply isn't half as good. Go with the original. You'll thank me for it if you ever get suckered in to watching the new one after viewing the original.<p>Anyhow, the DVD itself is great; Stunningly gorgeous 16:9 transfer, suprisingly good DTS audio, a brand new comentary, I think if fans didn't already know the box set was coming, they'd be on their knees thanking Anchor Bay for this marvelous DVD. But, for those of you who don't want to have to buy it twice, wait and see what the box brings. I have a feeling I'll own them both.<p>Romero's masterpiece deserves no less. Now, if only that new set would contain the 150 min. German composite print...<p>And, by the way. There is no alternate ending. It was written in the script that everyone dies, but never filmed for various reasons. If you want to see how much Romero's &quot;Dead&quot; films often veer off from how they were written, find the original screenplay for 'Day of the Dead'. It's barely recognizable compared to the finished film.<p>Getting 4 stars, only because we're sure to get a lot more fun when the box set comes out this Fall.

The transfer onto dvd for this nearly 30 year horror film is nothing short but incredible.  The resolution is crystal clear, and the sound is excellent.  The creepy soundtrack alone is enough to raise the hair on your arms let alone the grim visage on the screen as the story unfolds before you.<br />  The story is pretty simple, and Romeros camera work lets it unfold like a long lunch.  From the long pans of the gased up hunter picking off zombies as if they were empty beer cans to the panaramic shots of the deserted suburban shopping mall where the film takes place.  Our four survivors hold up in a pittsbugh shopping mall and slowly make the place their own in stylish late 70's chic.<br />  The characters while never really going overboard with background quickly become endearing to the viewer, and to this day still represent classic &quot;Movie Heroes&quot;.  Make-up artist Tom Savini makes a memorable cameo as a biker leading an army of malcontents intent on taking the mall away from our heroes.  Well one thing leads to another and before too long zombies are ripping bodies apart in graphic all to familiar form.  The special effects of the New Dawn don't seem to be as &quot;In Your Face Like A Hammer&quot; as the original, and even i was getting a little sqeamish during one particularly horrific scene involving a prone biker, and a pack of very hungry zombies.  The scene still dusturbs me even after all these years.<br />  The extras are nice but do seem a little sparse for such a cult classic, but its been nearly 30 years.  any &quot;lost&quot; footage or Bonus scenes are most likely nearly disintegrated with age.  The price is very nice for such classic, well put together Horror classic.<br />  I can solidly reccommend this for the not so faint at heart.  After watching this you'll never look at shopping malls the same again.

The other extras, mostly trailers,t.v. spots, and something you dont always see..radiospots are all well reproduced.

If you like horror films and haven't seen this one, you're in for quite a treat.  By far the best and most fun of George Romero's &quot;Dead&quot; triology, this is also, in my opinion,  the best horror film ever made.<p>Four survivors of a world-wide  yawning-grave zombie plague hole up in an abandoned shopping mall and fend  off the mindless swarm of zombies that pose a threat to their continued  existence.<p>Romero does a terrific job of constructing an equally creepy  and adventurous atmosphere.  Being a child of the seventies, some of my  earliest memories are of wandering around large shopping malls in tow of my  mom.  Place has always been an important thing for me, and this movie is  definitely a movie with a spirit of &quot;place&quot;.  This movie touched  something deep in me the first time I saw it when I was about 14, and I've  loved it ever since.  There's plenty of wonder, adventure, fun, and humor  to balance the film's apocolyptic creepiness and bright-red comic book  gore.  I also love the love-of-film-making which makes itself so evident in  the film's camera angles, editing, choice of music, and montage shots.<p>It  would doubtlessly be terrifying to truly be one of the last few people left  on the face of the earth with warm blood flowing through your veins, but  there's something about imagining banding together with a couple of friends  and taking on a world of zombies that seems so...well, so fun.  &quot;Dawn  of the Dead&quot; makes it seem like it might just be the time of your  life.<p>An excellent film, maybe not perfect in all technical senses, but  clearly making up for any flaws with an abundance of style, mood, and  substance.<p>I just hope George Romero decides to release another version  of this DVD including a commentary track, as he did with the recent DVD  relases of his other great films &quot;Knightriders&quot; and  &quot;Martin&quot;.  Of course, I also hope his name will be returning to  the big screen sometime soon.

Yes...But still a classic.	review/text: The reviews previous to this are pretty much accurate.  Romero's follow is probably one of the 10 best Horror movies of the 1970's.  However, while other (such as the Texas Chainsaw Massacre) trys to grab you by pushing the  limits with shock, Georgie boy goes the other way by getting you to think  just a touch.<p>This movie is not really a sequel to Night of the Living  Dead (one of the top 10 of the 1960's), but can be seen as related (set 1~2  years after).  Man is in dire danger, as the dead have come back to life.  Civilization is breaking down and choas is helping the Zombie's win.  Four  survivors take off in a helicopter and are forced to land on the roof of a  shopping mall, surrounded by Zombies.  <p>The movie paints broad strokes,  the characters are just not really developed enough.  The movie is about  materialism and greed, and how our current society is based more on  emptiness (using the shopping mall as a mecca as an example) rather than  any sound foundation.  <p>The DVD is bare, with a few features (the  funniest being an advertisement for the mall, where the movie was shot).  There is no audio commentary and the soundtrack was in Mono.  However, if  you like horror movies to be alittle less about T&amp;A and Gore, try out  the Dawn of the Dead.....Before there is no more room in hell....Rating: B.

The story and suspense of  Romero's film are extraordinary: four people flee from the marauding zombie  hordes into a giant shopping mall, establish a refuge for themselves and  hunt the undead down to find themselves in every consumer's dream:  everything they want and/or need for free! &quot;Dawn of the Dead&quot; is  not only a incredibly good horror flick but also a clever satire on our  greedy society. Never again has another director achieved the same effect.

DAWN OF THE DEAD is an epic horror, and no other zombie film in exisitence, or ANY horror film has been able to out-do this masterpiece.<p>This film in Romero's dead trilogy takes place a  few weeks after Night of the Living Dead. Society is going to hell...people  are rioting, killing each other, and destroying everything...and isn't that  funny? Most of the problems are not caused by the zombies THEMSELVES...but  by the humans. A very accurate statement on the human race. However, a TV  traffic reporter decides that he and his girlfriend, along with a couple of  SWAT officers, should &quot;borrow&quot; the station helicopter and get the  hell out of Dodge. They do so, and find themselves landing on a large  shopping mall after a series of close calls. The longer they hole up in the  mall, however, the more they become ambitious. They then decide to take  over the mall, and shut out the dead....they live in a paradise that  quickly eats them away...but they have a trouble headed towards them worse  than any zombies.<p>This movie has it all, awesome music by GOBLIN,  adventure, action, horror, and comedy. You really love the characters, who  develop quite nicely throughout the movie. In my humble opinion, this film  has one of (if not the best) endings in horror history. No, don't expect  any twists...it's just one of the best, and represents a sour victory  perfectly.<p>Every human being owes it to themselves to be treated with  this wonderful movie. Buy it.

I am sure most of you already know it is about a group of people trapped in a mall while a world of zombies wonders around outside, eventually making their way inside the mall. I think the acting is high schoolish, as was the acting in the follow up &quot;Day Of The Dead&quot;. Some of the zombie make up looks  like amateurs dressing up for Halloween. But I do agree this is a classic. I would not agree this is the greatest horror film ever made as been said by many reviewers. I still prefer &quot;Day Of The Dead&quot; over this film. Some people think Romero can do no wrong, and I like some of his work, but I simply do not believe the zombie concept  belongs to him, as so many people seem to think. I also wish everyone would stop comparing every &quot;walking dead&quot; film to Romero's work.

Romero's Dawn of the Dead is an unlikely masterpiece.  It had a very modest budget and only a couple months to complete.  Since they filmed in a real mall, they could only shoot late at night; making it tough for all personnel.  If that isn't bad enough, there wasn't enough money for any big name actors or actresses.  With so many odds against it, somehow the film found a path to success.  Word-of-mouth clearly had a lot of impact, because the film finally quenched horror fans thirst for gore. The prior success of Night of the Living Dead also had an affect on the success of Dawn of the Dead.  The film works well in many genres and it has a great script.  Dawn of the Dead is a spellbinding masterpiece that visually shows the labor of love and all the blood, sweat and tears that went into the film..<br /><br />Multiple genres used in the film creates a broader fan base.  Dawn of the Dead uses horror and fantasy as a foundation.  Essentially, zombies are very eerie.  Unlike vampires, zombies have a very authentic notion to them.  The fact that they contain no ridiculous characteristics, fabricates a rational fear.  In essence, George A. Romero invented the "flesh eating" zombie (inspired by I Am Legend), which is a scarier idea than the typical mind controlled-voodoo zombies in earlier films.  Dawn of the Dead is brilliant because it uses themes of science and religious conviction as devices of horror.  It's never confirmed whether if it's a virus like in Resident Evil, or if it's the end times suggested by a character in the film named Peter, who said "When there's no more room in Hell, the dead will walk the earth."  Behind the dreadfulness, a luxurious fantasy is at hand.  Once you let go of the idea that zombies look like people, the film fabricates a fun proposal; survive by any means necessary.  It provides a fantasy that people can actually use guns to survive, as opposed to plainly murder in cold blood.  In the film, a bunch of rednecks and military soldiers use the scenario as a zombie hunting game, but the main characters find a fantasy of their own.  Imagine going to the mall and getting everything for free. Is it worth risking your life fighting through the hordes of zombies?<br /><br />The film has a really smart script. All the characters are relatable and dynamic. Stephen is a soldier.  He has a quick wit, bubbly personality, and gets along with everybody.  At the beginning of the film he's very rational, but when he gets too comfortable with the situation, that's when he takes a dynamic change for the worst.  His foolish actions got him bitten; eventually he died.  Peter is an African American soldier.  He is even-tempered, reserved, and looked upon as knowing the answers.  He is probably the least dynamic character; however, his friendship with Roger is dynamic.  Francine is the only female among this particular group of survivors.  At the beginning of the film, she's very overlooked; by the end of the film, her importance was vital.  Roger is the most dynamic character, and the most important character.  He's Francine's boyfriend, and Stephen's best friend.  He's also the only one who knows how to navigate a helicopter.  Eventually, he teaches Francine.  As far as him being dynamic; he was perceived as the weakest character.  His change was so gradual, that as an viewer, we realized it after he turned into a zombie.  Unlike George A. Romero's other films in the Dead series, this one had an emotional attachment to the characters.  It's also attention-grabbing that an African American was portrayed as the lead character.  Besides the script containing interesting character, it also contains an interesting plot delivery system.  The characters didn't really have any plans, apart from surviving.  Instead of characters following a certain predictable plot, the plot followed the characters.  That's very effective when it comes to keeping the viewers' interest.<br /><br />It's safe to say that Dawn of the Dead is George A. Romero's magnum opus. It's like Apocalypse Now, but in a urban setting and with zombies.  I'm a critic about everything, and there's nothing I say to criticize this film.  With a modest budget, and limited resources, this is the best film is could possibly be.  As far as the zombie genre is concerned, only a few films have inhaled the tour de force "aroma" of Dawn of the Dead.  Films such as 28 Days Later, Planet Terror and the Dawn of the Dead remake.  But George A. Romero's Dawn of the Dead, made in 1978, still sets high standards for films in any genre.

I've seen the original but have heard of a Europian version as well. I am pleased to say that before you here is the ultimate Dawn of the Dead (hence the name). You have the good old original theatrical vesion that you know and love to death, But also here you are given some real special treats.<br /><br />Dawn of the Dead Europian version: Here we have a shorter and slightly more darker version of the U.S. version. While basicaly it's the same movie, a lot of the hurmor in the original version is edited out. Originaly called Zombi in Europe.<br /><br />Dawn of the Dead: Exteneded version: Here we have a 12 minute longer version of the original which was actualy the version which premered at the Cannes Film Festival. Intersting what was edided out here including a cameo by Joe Pilato who would later return in Day of the Dead as the revolver toting army Captain with the bad attitude.<br /><br />Documentaries: A great collection of cast and crew interviews, original making of documentary, home movies, and what I liked the best a Monroeville Mall tour with none other than Ken Foree as your guide which was done right before the mall was unfortunatly demolished.<br /><br />You are also given trailers, stills, Commecials for the mall, and a mini comic book containing over 20 pages from the Dawn of the Dead paperback comic. To say it simpily, if you love this movie you will love this set. 3 differn't versions along with tons of extras make this a must for any horror fan.
